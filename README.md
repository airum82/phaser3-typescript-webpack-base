# Phaser3-typescript-webpack-base

This is a base configuration I made to try out phaser3 with typescript. It is very bare bones but it works for me. Feel free to use it. I will install the appropriate linters on my own projects but will probably leave them off this base config. I did not use the HTMLwebpackplugin because it seemed unnecessary but I could definitely be wrong on this.

# Install

```clone the repo```

```npm install```

you should be good to go now, hope it helps!
